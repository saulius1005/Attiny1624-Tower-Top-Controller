/**
 * @brief Reads the angular position from the MT6701 sensor using SSI communication.
 *
 * This function initiates an SSI communication session by pulling the chip select (CSN) low,
 * transmitting dummy data to generate a clock signal, and receiving the corresponding data bits.
 * The received data is then processed to extract the angle, magnetic field status, push button status,
 * and track status.
